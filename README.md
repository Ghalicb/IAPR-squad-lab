## Analysis of card game images in realistic settings

### Project

Detection of cards on a small set of images corresponding to photographies of realistic situations of Battle card game, extraction of the color and rank of the cards in order to determine the winner according to a set of rules (constraints).

The most challenging issues we had to tackle were that the position and orientation of the cards were not deterministic, the brightness of the images changed a lot from one situation to another and the rank of the cards were drawn from MNIST dataset and therefore were not similar.

### Labs

The repository also contains 3 mini-projects, each focusing on a different part of an image analysis pipeline.
